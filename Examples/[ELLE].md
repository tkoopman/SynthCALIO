SynthCALIO version of "ELLE's Armor Mods - SPID Addons" by SauteedPanda

Link: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/139703

All files starting with [ELLE] are each of the SPIDs included in the above mod. They are all standalone and do not require the original SPID Addons mod to work.

While I have separated them into individual files, that is just for easy maintenance. There is no problem installing all, even if you only have some of ELLE's Armor Mods installed.

# Requirements
- SynthCALIO (and working Synthesis of course)
- ELLE's Armor Mods - Only the ones you want. Any you don't have will be ignored.
- Spell Perk Item Distributor (SPID) - Any outfit assigned directly to a NPC will work without this, but some are assigned via SPID.
